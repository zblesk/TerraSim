# TerraSim

My goal was to design an environment the agent can explore, reason about, categorize various objects it encounters
and observe results of its actions. The simulation itself is implemented as a module for TerraSim â€“ a solution 
working as a network server, allowing remote control of agents. Single- as well as multi-agent scenarios are supported. 
The modular architecture of TerraSim enables the user to easily define multiple different scenarios with various sets 
of sensors, actuators or even whole worlds, making its potential uses quite broad. We also provide usage examples,
an application for controlling the agent in any kind of simulation and a visualization application.

There is no binary release provided; you will have to download and compile the source code. 
The process should be effortless in Visual Studio 2010. The only dependency is the Json.NET library.
