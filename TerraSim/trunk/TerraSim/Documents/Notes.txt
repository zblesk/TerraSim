Agent's actions:

Agent will recieve a string containing the action name. 
If the name is a key in the dictionary, the actuator [value for the given key in the dictionary] 
performs its action with recieved arguments.

possible improvements: 

 * namespacing of actuator commands - if A and B have action Do, it can be auto-disambiguated to A.Do, B.Do.
 * In ForestWorld, 1 actuator => 1 concurrent action. Workaround possible - multiple actuators. See 'namespacing.'
 * The message system should be reworked, so that also actuators and sensors can receive dynamic messages. 

Light update cycle:
	first, update weather
	update light [dawn/dusk/day/night]
	add up the parts

Messaging system: 
	No malicious intent is expected. Therefore, if you know how, you could drain a different agent's energy.
	It could be fixed by assigning a random number to each agent that only he (and his sensors+actuators)
	would know about, then use it to identify all messages directed at them.
